# FinePrint

Most of us have gone through this, while applying for jobs, while buy new phones, or signing up for a new website, skipping through the entire privacy policy and almost *everyone* clicks **“I Agree”** without reading the fine print.


Why?

Because the documents meant to inform us — ****privacy policies, terms of service, consent forms, job application disclosures, airline policies** — are:

* **Extremely long** (average privacy policy: 3,000–8,000 words)
* **Difficult to understand** (legal jargon + vague wording)
* **Designed to obscure** risks, restrictions, and hidden obligations
* **Non-standardized and inconsistent across companies**

As a result:

* Users unknowingly consent to **data sharing**, **location tracking**, **AI-based hiring decisions** , or**selling of behavioral data**
* Travelers miss compensation rights because **airline refund or delay policies** hide exceptions deep in the document.
* Job applicants accept **arbitration agreements**, **criminal background checks**, or **data retention policies** without realizing the implications.
* Consumers lose money through **auto-renewals**, **hidden fees**, and **non-refundable clauses**

This creates a massive transparency gap:

**People sign legal agreements they don’t actually understand.**


Core things, I want this project to solve

* Identify and extract relevant clauses from long documents
* Classify them into categories (e.g., “Data Sharing”, “Refund Policy”, “Background Checks”)
* Detect **pitfalls, risks, loopholes, fees, rights**
* Summarize each clause in **plain, simple, human language**
* Deliver everything instantly, at the moment the user needs it
* Make it accessible (via Chrome extension first, later web app / API)
