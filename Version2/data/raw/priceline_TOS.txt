Arbitration and Dispute Resolution

Disputes and Arbitration
Priceline is committed to customer satisfaction. If you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve it. If we are unsuccessful, you may pursue your claim as explained in this section.

You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any problem, dispute, or claim relating in any way to the Sites and/or any of its related applications or services; any dealings with Priceline, including with our marketing and customer service agents; the purchase, use, or performance of any services or products available through this Site; any representations made by Priceline; or our Privacy Policy (collectively, â€œClaimsâ€) by providing Notice to Customer Support. Unless prohibited by applicable law, any Claim must be brought within two (2) years from the date on which such Claim arose or accrued. If we are unable to resolve your Claims within 60 days of receipt, you may seek relief through arbitration or small claims court, as set forth below. This informal process is a condition precedent to your ability to initiate a claim in arbitration or small claims court.

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America, without regard to conflict of laws. All Claims or other matters in dispute between you or any Third- party and Priceline, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site, whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of laws provisions that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Mandatory Arbitration
Please read this provision carefully. It requires that any and all claims must be resolved by binding arbitration or in small claims court, and it prevents you from pursuing a class action or similar proceeding in any forum. These limitations apply to any claims against Priceline, its subsidiaries or affiliates, any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site.

In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by an arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. The arbitratorâ€™s decision will generally be final and binding, with no right of appeal. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than court procedures.

By using this Site, you, any Third-party, and Priceline agree that any Claim, including claims regarding the applicability or validity of this arbitration provision, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the then applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA ("Rules and Procedures"), except that, pursuant to subsection (e) below, under no circumstances may any claim be brought or arbitrated as a class action or proceed on a basis involving claims brought on a purported representative capacity (either on behalf of the general public or other users or persons, except that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award public injunctive relief where applicable).

As an exception to arbitration, you, any Third-party, and Priceline retain the right to pursue in a small claims court located in the federal judicial district that includes you or the Third-partyâ€™s billing address at the time of the Claim, any Claim that is within the courtâ€™s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis. All Claims you or a Third-party bring against Priceline, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site must be resolved in accordance with this Disputes and Arbitration Section. All Claims filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed and void.

If you decide to seek arbitration, you must first send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") addressed to: Legal Department, priceline.com LLC, 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, CT 06854 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Priceline and you, or Priceline and any Third-party, do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you, or the Third-party, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you, any Third-party, or Priceline is entitled. The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures, or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon.

To the extent that any Claim is held not to be subject to arbitration and proceeds in a Court other than small claims court, such Claim shall be filed only in the United States District Court for Connecticut or, if there is no federal jurisdiction over the action, in the courts of the State of Connecticut located in Fairfield County, Connecticut. You hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such Claim that is not subject to the arbitration provision and not pursued in small claims court, and agree that any such claim shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action (as described more fully in section I.A.2.d below). You further agree that any and all Claims or other matters asserted in such dispute, whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of laws provisions that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

You and any Third-party further agree that no proceeding against Priceline, its affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site (under this provision or otherwise) may proceed as a class actionâ€™ or proceed on a basis involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity (either on behalf of the general public or other users or persons). However, where applicable, the arbitrator shall have the authority to award equitable or injunctive relief which necessarily may affect the rights and obligations of persons not party to the arbitration (i.e. public injunctive relief).

Upon motion of one or more affected parties, the arbitrator may, in its discretion, consolidate more than one arbitration with one or more related arbitrations involving similar claims in an effort to ensure that the arbitration process is an efficient, timely and cost-effective alternative to litigation. All parties will retain the right to request an individualized hearing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator may not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding that would affect the rights of any individual, unless that individual has actually initiated and is currently maintaining a demand for arbitration pursuant to this Agreement.

In order to initiate arbitration, each party will be responsible for paying the filing fees required by the AAA. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Priceline will pay as much of your filing fee in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation. For any arbitration involving Claims that together seek damages that exceed $25,000, if you, or any Third-party, prevail in the arbitration of any Claim against Priceline, Priceline will reimburse such prevailing party for any fees or costs the prevailing party paid to AAA in connection with the arbitration.

If you prevail in the arbitration, the arbitrator may award you statutory damages and/or your reasonable attorney fees and expenses, to the extent that the arbitrator believes them to be necessary or mandated by law. Any dispute regarding attorneyâ€™s fees to be paid pursuant to this paragraph will be decided by the arbitrator who decided the underlying Claim. If you or the Third-party do not prevail on the claim or prevail but are awarded an amount less than or equal to Pricelineâ€™s last written settlement offer to you, Priceline will pay only the amount of the award, not the minimum recovery.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any of the Rules and Procedures established by AAA which may be to the contrary, Priceline will not be entitled to seek reimbursement of its attorneyâ€™s fees for any Claim the arbitrator finds to be non-frivolous.

With the exception of sub-part (d) above (the class action waiver), if any part of this arbitration provision is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (d) above (the class action waiver) is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor any Third-party, nor Priceline shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

Arbitration rules and forms may be obtained from AAA at https://www.adr.org or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

If you or any Third-party do not choose to accept this binding arbitration provision, you or such third-party must notify Priceline in writing by certified mail within thirty (30) days of your purchase or before you begin to use the services purchased on this Site, whichever date is sooner. Such notice shall be sent to the notice address defined in subsection (b), above. If you so notify us by that time that you do not accept the binding arbitration provision, you and any such third-party may not continue to purchase services or products on this Site unless and until Priceline notifies you or such third-party otherwise. Priceline shall have the right to prohibit your and such Third-partyâ€™s future purchase of services or products on this Site.

Credit Card Chargebacks
You, the User, have the ability to dispute charges with credit card companies ("chargebacks"). If you have a question about a charge on your credit card statement, we encourage you to call Priceline prior to disputing a charge with your credit card company to discuss any questions or concerns about our charges with us. Priceline will work with you in resolving your concerns. Priceline retains the right to dispute any chargeback that it believes is improper, as described more fully below. Priceline also retains the right to cancel any travel reservation in the event of a chargeback related to that reservation.

By using our service to make a reservation with a Supplier, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation policy of that Supplier. In all cases, the cancellation policy of each reservation is made available on our webSite. Please note that certain rates or special offers are not eligible for cancellation or change. Priceline deems the following chargeback scenarios as improper and retains the right to investigate and rebut any such chargeback claims and to recover costs of such chargeback claims from You, the User.

Chargebacks resulting from non-cancellable reservations in the event that Priceline or the Supplier cannot provide a refund, whether or not the reservation is used.
Chargebacks resulting from charges authorized by family, friends, associates or other third parties with direct access to You, the Userâ€™s, credit card.
Chargebacks arising from the Supplierâ€™s failure to deliver a product or service in a manner thatâ€™s consistent with the Supplierâ€™s product description.
Chargebacks resulting from force majeure or other circumstances that are beyond the control of Priceline.com or its subsidiaries.

You will be charged in the currency shown upon checkout in the Summary of Charges. If you make a purchase from us using a credit or debit card, please be aware that, due to the constant fluctuation in exchange rates, our charge to your card or the estimated charge amount we provide you, may differ based on the exchange rate at the time you make your reservation versus the rate at the time the charge is reflected on your credit card statement. Also, in the event that we must credit your account, we will refund the exact amount in the currency initially charged and will not be responsible for any fluctuations in exchange rates which may cause differences in your billing statement.

Flights

Airline Rules
Airline tickets available through this Site are subject to the published conditions of carriage and rules, including but not limited to cancellation policies, of the applicable airline. The contract of carriage in use by the applicable airline, when issued, shall be between the applicable airline and passenger. Airlines retain the right to adjust flight times and schedules at any time, and may in their discretion change or cancel flights or itineraries. Different tickets on the same airline may carry different restrictions or include different services.

Code Share
Some airlines enter into "code share" agreements with a limited number of select airline partners. This means that on certain routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the flight does not fly its own aircraft to that destination. Instead, it contracts with a partner airline to fly to that destination. The partner airline is listed as "operated by." In most cases you will check in with your "operating" carrier; however, you should verify your flight check-in location with your ticketing carrier. If your flight is a code share, it will be disclosed to you in the booking process and prior to your payment on a price disclosed, retail airline ticket. If your Express DealsÂ® itinerary contains a code share, it will be disclosed to you when your booking is confirmed, along with other itinerary information.

Hazardous Materials
Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in your luggage or on your person. A violation can result in five yearsâ€™ imprisonment and penalties of $250,000 or more (49 U.S.C. 5124). Hazardous materials include explosives, compressed gases, flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers, poisons, corrosives and radioactive materials. Examples include paints, lighter fluid, fireworks, tear gases, oxygen bottles, and radio-pharmaceuticals. There are special exceptions for small quantities (up to 70 ounces total) of medicinal and toilet articles carried in your luggage and certain smoking materials carried on your person. For more information, see https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/.

Airline Prohibited Practices
You agree not to purchase a ticket or tickets containing flight segments that you will not be using, such as a "point-beyond", "hidden-city", or "back-to-back tickets" if those practices are prohibited by the airline(s). You further agree not to purchase a round-trip ticket that you plan to use only for one-way travel if that practice is prohibited by the airline(s). You acknowledge that most airlines prohibit all such tickets, and therefore we do not guarantee that the airline will honor your ticket or tickets if you engage in these practices. You agree to indemnify the Covered Parties against airline claims, on the basis of these or any other prohibited practices, for the difference between the full fare of your actual itinerary and the value of the ticket or tickets that you purchased.

Use of Flight Segments
Most airlines require you to use flight coupons in sequential order. For those airlines who allow the use of a ticket for only one segment, if you do not cancel all or part of your journey prior to the departure of any segment of your itinerary, you may forfeit up to the value of your airline ticket, depending on the rules of the fare purchased.

One Way Tickets
For certain itineraries, you are able to purchase two one way tickets on the Site rather than a round trip fare. If you do so, you will be making two separate bookings with two separate and different rules and policies (for example, for baggage fees, change fees, and refunds). Any changes made to one of your bookings will not affect the other booking (for example, if your initial flight is cancelled by either you or the airline, the other airline with which you booked your return flight is not obligated to issue a refund or change your itinerary). If you are traveling internationally, you may need to provide proof that you have a return flight at check in and at immigration.

Information Required by The Transportation Security Administration ("TSA")
The TSA of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires us to collect information from you for purposes of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA Privacy policies, or to view the system of records notice and privacy impact assessment, please see TSA's Web site at www.tsa.gov.

TSA Real ID Requirements ("TSA")
It is your responsibility to ensure that you have obtained any necessary identification for your travel, that will be accepted by airport security. For Transportation Security Administration â€œReal IDâ€ requirements, go to https://www.tsa.gov/real-id.

Additional Restrictions for Flight Express Deals® Flights
The following restrictions apply to Priceline's Express Deals® flight service:

All flight reservations are non-cancelable, non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable by you. Once you purchase a reservation, your method of payment will be charged for the amount shown - regardless of whether or not the reservation is used. Credit will not be given for any unused reservations and cannot be used toward any future purchases.
We or the airline may, on an exception basis and at the request of the airline passenger, waive one or more of the restrictions after the flight has been booked. We may, in our discretion, impose additional obligations and/or fees in connection with any such waiver.

Taxes and Fees on Published Price Airline Tickets
Government imposed taxes and fees and any applicable airline imposed fees are included in your fare. Tax rates in effect at time of purchase are applied to your ticket price. Retroactive tax rate increases may be the responsibility of the traveler.

Itinerary Changes/Cancellations/Refunds
Air travel itinerary changes, if permitted by the airline fare rules, may have a change fee charged by the airline typically ranging between $200 and $300 USD per ticket that will vary by market, carrier and specific fare rule. In addition, any changes made with Priceline to your itinerary will incur a per ticket Priceline processing fee.

Baggage and Other Ancillary Airline Fees
Airlines may require you to pay additional fees at the airport for certain services and/ or if you exceed certain limits as dictated by the airline, such as the number of bags or weight allowed, and some airlines do not offer a free baggage allowance. Some airlines charge additional fees for other services, for example, for carryon baggage, priority boarding and seat assignments. During the booking process, Priceline provides a summary of key terms of an airlineâ€™s baggage fees, but each airline should be consulted for complete information about its baggage and ancillary fees.

International Travel

Passports, Visas, Hazards, and Disinsection
It is your responsibility to ensure that you have obtained any necessary visas for your international travel, and that your passport will be accepted. You may be required to obtain a visa to transit a country, even if that country is not your final destination.

Although most travel, including to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Priceline urges passengers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States Government prior to booking travel to international destinations. For State Department travel warnings and advisories, go to https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html. For foreign health requirements and dangers, go to www.cdc.gov/travel/index.htm. Other information relating to particular international destinations can be found at www.dot.gov, www.tsa.gov, www.faa.gov, https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country.html, www.treas.gov/ofac, or www.cbp.gov.

Although not commonly used, disinsection is permitted under international law in order to protect public health, agriculture and the environment. The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization stipulate two approaches for aircraft disinsection--either spray the aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board or treat the aircraft's interior surfaces with a residual insecticide (residual method) while passengers are not on board. For more information about disinsection or to review a list of airline contacts for disinsection and a list of countries that require disinsection, please visit the Department of Transportation webSite at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/spray.

By offering or facilitating travel to or from particular international destinations, we do not represent or warrant that travel to or from such points is advisable or without risk, and we shall not be liable for damages or losses that may result from travel to or from such destinations.

Airline Entry/Exit Fees
If you are traveling internationally, some countries or airports charge fees upon entering and/or exiting the country. These fees are not included in the ticket price, or the taxes and fees we display on our webSite prior to purchase. For more information on a specific country's entry/exit fee, we suggest that you visit www.travel.state.gov prior to departure.

Hotels

General

Pricing
Sometimes cheaper rates are available for a specific stay at a hotel, however, these rates made available by hotels may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example regarding cancellation and refund. Please check the room and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Prices, rates and inventory are subject to availability from the hotel.

Check In
Upon check-in, the reservation holder must present a valid ID and credit card or, in the hotel's discretion, debit card, in his or her name (the amount of available credit required will vary by hotel). To check in, the guest on the reservation must meet the hotel's minimum age requirement, provided on the checkout page for any hotel reservation made on this Site.

Double Occupancy
All hotel reservations are guaranteed for double occupancy (i.e. 2 adults). Unless specifically noted, accommodations for more than two adults are not guaranteed. Some hotels may not allow extra guests. If your hotel does allow extra guests, there may be additional charges. These charges vary and will be payable directly to the hotel.

Late Arrival and Failure to Check-in on First Night
While you should call Priceline if you wish to cancel a cancellable reservation in advance of your stay, if you are going to be delayed on your date of check in or find that you cannot check in to your hotel on the date you requested, you should contact the hotel to let them know. If you fail to check in to your hotel on the day of your reservation and do not alert the hotel, the remaining portion of your reservation may be canceled and you may not be entitled to a refund, depending on the terms and conditions of the applicable hotel.

Cancellations and Changes to Your Reservation
Hotel cancellation policies vary. Certain reservations are non-cancellable and non-changeable. Others require you to pay a penalty if you cancel. Still others are fully refundable. Check the hotel cancellation policy when you book.

Disability Needs
If you have disability needs, you must call the hotel and verify that your disability needs can be met. If your disability needs cannot be accommodated by the hotel, please call Priceline customer service.

Hotel Accommodations and Special Requests
Depending upon which Priceline hotel reservation service you use, you may or may not be able to select your room type and number and type of beds (as is the case for Name Your Own Price® and Express Deals®). Room assignments are based on hotel availability and are at the hotel's discretion. For hotels that allow smoking on premises, we cannot guarantee a non-smoking room for every property. If you have special requests, you must call the hotel and verify that it can meet your special requests after you have made your booking. Priceline.com cannot accommodate or guarantee that special requests will be met.

Hotel Star Ratings
Priceline's proprietary star rating system is provided for your reference. Like other hotel rating systems, Priceline considers a number of factors in evaluating the quality of participating hotels such as: amenities, facilities, reputation, brand, other rating services, customer feedback from guests who have stayed at the hotel, etc., to assign a single star rating. Priceline screens participating hotels carefully and updates our information periodically to ensure the validity of our ratings. Our ratings systems may sometimes differ from those of other rating systems that you may be familiar with. We do not warrant or guarantee that our star rating system is equal to or consistent with any other star rating system and reserve the right to change a hotel's rating at any time with or without notice.

Charges for Taxes and Fees
In connection with facilitating your transaction, we will charge your method of payment for Taxes and Fees. This charge includes an anticipated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we anticipate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.

Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, bill all applicable taxes to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.

For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your debit or credit card for Taxes and Fees includes an additional payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.

Depending on the property you stay at you may also be charged (i) certain mandatory hotel specific service fees, for example, resort fees, energy surcharges, newspaper delivery fees, in-room safe fees, tourism fees, or housekeeping fees and/or (ii) certain optional incidental fees, for example, parking charges, minibar charges, phone calls, room service and movie rentals, etc. These charges, if applicable, will be payable by you to the hotel directly at checkout. When you check in, a credit card or, in the hotel's discretion, a debit card, will be required to secure these charges and fees that you may incur during your stay. Please contact the hotel directly as to whether and which charges or service fees apply.

The charges may also include destination marketing fees collected by the hotel and passed along to tourist bureaus. If you are a citizen of a country other than the United States and you travel to your home country, you may owe additional taxes to the hotel at check out. Contact the hotel if you have questions.

Express Deals® Hotel Service
The following restrictions apply to Priceline's Express Deals® hotel service:

Unless specifically noted otherwise, all hotel reservations are non-cancelable, non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable by you. Once you purchase a reservation, your method of payment will be charged for the amount shown - regardless of whether or not the reservation is used.

The price listed is per night and does not include Pricelineâ€™s charge to you for Taxes and Fees.
For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told both a) the Total Priceline Charges to your method of payment and b) the total cost, which includes the Total Priceline Charges and the Hotel Mandatory Fee which the hotel will charge at check out. Your Total Charges and the Room Rate may include compensation to priceline.com for our facilitation services.
If you have special room requests (including, for example, preferences for smoking or nonsmoking rooms, a specific room, particular bedding, floor location, connecting rooms, or pet accommodations), you must call the hotel and verify that special requests can be met after you have made your booking. Priceline.com cannot accommodate special requests in advance of your booking and cannot guarantee that special requests will be met. A hotel reservation cannot be refunded, canceled or modified on the basis that a special request was not (or could not be) met by the hotel.

Name Your Own Price® Hotel Service
The restrictions described above in the Express DealsÂ® section also apply to Pricelineâ€™s Name Your Own Price® hotel service. Additionally, once you submit a request on the Site, you cannot modify it.

The "median retail price" which we may display to you is the median of the lowest rates our participating hotels are offering to the general public for the exact or approximate travel dates you selected based on information our hotel suppliers have loaded. These rates are based on the quality level you chose, the city, and the area you selected. These rates are available through our disclosed hotel service or were recorded at the time of booking and do not include rates that are restricted to membership programs. Although we routinely review this data, we make no guarantee or warranty, with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the data used or provided. Further, we make no guarantee or warranty that a room will be available below or within the disclosed price range. The ranges are provided to you solely for information purposes and are not actual rates. All hotel pricing information is subject to change without notice.

Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service
Priceline.comâ€™s Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service is a hotel service whereby the price of the hotel is disclosed to the User in advance of booking and whereby priceline.com acts as the merchant of record on the transaction (i.e., directly charges your credit card).

For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told both a) the Total Priceline Charges to your method of payment and b) the total cost, which includes the Total Priceline Charges and the Hotel Mandatory Fee which the hotel will charge at check out.

Agency Hotel Service
For Pricelineâ€™s Agency Hotel Service, Priceline is not the merchant of record and does not charge your credit card or other form of payment. For these transactions, if you are required to enter a credit card number, you will be notified that your credit card will be used to guarantee the reservation and that the hotel will charge you directly for room and tax and any other charges. Certain accommodations only accept cash even if a credit card is used to book the reservation; this information will be disclosed to you. You will be provided with a "Total Estimated Charges" line item on your contract page that will provide you with an estimate of what the hotel will charge you, which will include taxes. Unless expressly stated, taxes and service fees are excluded from your room cost, but are shown to you in the "Taxes and Fees" line. Taxes are included in the Total Estimated Charges. For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told the Hotel Mandatory Fee which the hotel will charge at check out. Any mandatory fee is also included in the "Total Estimated Charges" line.

Agency Hotel Service reservations require credit or debit card details to guarantee your reservation. As such, we will send your credit or debit card information directly to the hotel at which your booking is made and we may verify (i.e. pre-authorize) your credit card as well. For certain rates or special offers that state that a deposit is required (which will be disclosed to you ), please note that your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged by the hotel (sometimes without any option for refund) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.

You accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of the hotel, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the hotel that may apply to your reservation or during your stay, including for services rendered and/or products offered by the hotel (the delivery terms and conditions of a hotel can be obtained with the relevant hotel). The general cancellation and no-show policy is made available on our website at the hotel information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email. Please note that certain rates or special offers that require an upfront deposit to the hotel (which will be disclosed in the Booking Conditions) are not eligible for cancellation or change. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.

Flexible Cancellation Rates
Priceline offers certain hotel rates that are cancellable, Flexible Cancellation Rates. The specific cancellation terms available for these rates vary from room to room, and will be listed in the "Important Information" displayed in the booking path for any particular Flexible Cancellation Rate. It is important You review the important information for Your particular room selection, as those cancellation terms will apply to Your reservation.

Certain Flexible Cancellation Rates are booked through a third party, Roomer Travel Inc.. ("Roomer"). These Rates offer hotel reservation services with a Cancellation Option for otherwise non-refundable reservations, in exchange for paying a Cancellation Option Fee. A Roomer Flexible Cancellation Rate allows You to cancel your hotel reservation up to 24 hours prior to flight departure date or hotel check-in date local time and receive a refund of 80% of your total hotel charge, subject to these additional terms. If you book a Roomer Flexible Cancellation Rate, you are entering into a transaction with Roomer, and Roomer, not Priceline, is the merchant of record.

If you book a Roomer Flexible Cancellation Rate and subsequently cancel Your Reservation, You (i) shall be entitled to receive the stated refund; and (ii) all Your rights in the Reservation shall be transferred to Roomer, subject to the booking terms set forth herein. Flexible Cancellation Rates booked through Roomer can be cancelled directly on this site, or by calling: (888) 674-6027. Following cancellation, the refund on your Reservation will be paid to You directly by Roomer within 14 days of cancellation, made to the same credit card used to pay for the Reservation.

Following the cancellation of Your Roomer Reservation, the Reservation shall become the sole property of Roomer and Roomer may use the Reservation in its discretion, including selling the Reservation to a third party (the "Secondary Sale"). In the event that Roomer completes a Secondary Sale of the Reservation, You shall not have any right to receive proceeds or commission in connection with such Secondary Sale.

Rental Cars

General
We act as a facilitator in your reservation of a car with the rental car supplier. Vehicle rentals available through this Site are subject to standard rental contracts of the car rental companies, which will be completed by you at the time of pick-up of a vehicle. Actual prices may vary depending on special requests and items purchased at the counter. Pricing may change if you pick-up, or drop-off the car at a different date, time or location than you requested in your reservation or for other reasons at the discretion of the rental car company. While you may request child seats and other special requests, the requests are not guaranteed and are provided at the discretion of the rental car company. At the time of pick up, the driver will be required to present a valid driver's license, and a valid credit card in his/her name. Some locations also accept debit cards; however, rental partners have different requirements for customers who will only have a debit card at the time of pickup. While our rental car partners strive to honor your request for car type (economy, full size, SUV etc.), your requested car type is not guaranteed to be available. Specific cars, makes and models are not guaranteed and listed car makes and model are for example only. Car fleet information including capacities is based on the latest information provided to us by the supplier and is subject to change.

Charges for Taxes and Service Fees
To facilitate your Express Deals® rental car transaction, we will charge your method of payment, in addition to base rate, a charge for Taxes and Fees (an amount that will always be disclosed to you before you elect to proceed). This charge includes an amount we pay on your behalf to recover the amount we pay to the rental car supplier in connection with your reservation for taxes, fees and surcharges owed by the rental car supplier including, without limitation, sales and use tax, excise tax, value added tax, airport or facility taxes, surcharges or fees and/or other similar taxes, surcharges or fees. The amount of this charge is intended by us to be sufficient to cover the amount we may be required to pay on your behalf to a rental car supplier, and may be greater or less than the amount we actually pay the rental car supplier in connection with your reservation for taxes, fees and surcharges. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee which we retain as part of the compensation for our facilitation services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs and additional fees. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors, such as the amount you pay to priceline.com and the location at which you will pick-up your car from the rental car supplier. The "Total Charges" that you will pay to Priceline for using our Express Deals® rental car service will always be disclosed to you before you submit your Request.

We are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities in respect of the rental car. The rental car companies, as vendors, collect all applicable taxes from us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors on your behalf. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes for the car rentals vary greatly by location and are determined by the rental car company.

In connection with facilitating your retail rental car transaction, we will attempt to provide you, when the information is available, with a breakdown of the estimated taxes, fees and surcharges that may apply to your transaction. We will not charge you for these taxes, fees and surcharges, but the car rental supplier will.

Express Deals®
The following restrictions apply to rental car Requests made using our Express Deals® services:

Priceline.com rental car reservations are non-changeable, non-endorsable, non-transferable and non-refundable;

When picking up the vehicle, a credit card or, in the rental car company's discretion, a debit card, will be required for a security deposit and to pay for any additional ancillary charges (including insurance, child seats, gas, etc.).
All rentals will include Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges ("TFS") associated with the Time and Mileage (T&M) for the rental based on the timing and pick-up/drop-off of the rental; and
If you choose to add on a child seat, the charge for reserving an infant seat varies by the rental company that accepts your request and is over what you paid Priceline for your reservation. These charges are payable directly to the rental company.
Cruises
Priceline Cruises are offered through a partnership with World Travel Holdings, Inc. ("WTH"). Please note that these are sold separately to you by WTH. Priceline merely provides the platform through which you book the cruise. Therefore, when you purchase or book a cruise, you are entering into a contract with WTH and you are subject to the Terms & Conditions of WTH. Please click here for WTHâ€™s Terms & Conditions.
