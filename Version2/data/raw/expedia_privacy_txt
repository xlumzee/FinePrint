Collection and Use of Your Personal Data
In this section, you will find information about:
the types of personal data that we collect and use,
how we collect and use it,
the purposes for which we collect and use it, and
the lawful basis we rely on to collect and use it.
Lawful bases for processing:
In the table below, you will find the lawful bases we rely on to collect and use your personal data.
In summary, whenever we collect or use your personal data, that collection or use must be based on one of the following criteria:
Consent: this means you have given your consent for us to do so (e.g., sending you marketing communications where consent is required).
Legal obligation: this means we have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or use it for a specific purpose (e.g. using your transaction history to complete our financial and tax obligations under the law).
Performance of a contract: this means the personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g., manage your booking, process payments, or create an account at your request),
If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data).
Legitimate interest: this means the processing is in our legitimate interests and those interests are not overridden by your rights (as explained below)
Certain countries and regions allow us to process personal data on the basis of legitimate interests. If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or the legitimate interests of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate or improve our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you, for security verification purposes when you contact us, to respond to your queries, to undertake marketing, or for the purpose of detecting or preventing illegal activities. Whatever our determination of our specific legitimate interest is for a given use of your personal data, when we assess its appropriateness, we will always assess it against the potential impact on your rights. While the concept of legitimate interest only exists in certain countries and regions, we balance our usage of your personal data against your rights globally.

International Data Transfer
The personal data we process may be accessed from, processed or transferred to countries other than the country in which you reside. Those countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. Such cross-border transfer of your personal data is necessary for us to service your transaction with us, and for the other purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement.
The servers for our platform are located in the United States, and the Expedia Group companies and third-party service providers operate in many countries around the world. When we collect your personal data, we may process it in any of those countries. Our employees may access your personal data from various countries around the world. The transferees of your personal data may also be located in countries other than the country in which you reside.
We have taken appropriate steps and put safeguards in place to help ensure that any access, processing and/or transfer of your personal data remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and in compliance with applicable data protection law. Such measures provide your personal data with a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that under the equivalent local law in your country, no matter where your data is accessed from, processed and/or transferred to. We will comply with obligations regarding personal data cross-border transfer in accordance with application data protection laws, regulations, and conditions set by the competent authorities. This may include fulfilling obligations such as security assessments and/or certifications and signing agreements with overseas recipients in accordance with the standard contract established by the competent authorities.
Some measures that we have in place include the following:
Adequacy decisions of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in certain non-EEA countries. Please see the latest list of such countries published by the European Commission here.
Transferee countries’ participation in the Global-CBPR forum. Please see the latest list of participant countries here. Expedia Group holds the Global-CBPR certification, and we have accordingly established measures across all Expedia Group companies to ensure that, where relevant to the transfer, personal data is shared in accordance with the CBPR requirements. Further detail on Expedia Group’s participation in such forum may be found in the Global Cross Border Privacy Rules System Participation section below.
Ensuring that the third-party partners, vendors and service providers to whom data transfers are made have appropriate mechanisms in place to protect your personal data. For instance, our agreements signed with our third-party partners, vendors and service providers incorporate strict data transfer terms (including, where applicable, the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission and/or United Kingdom, for transfers from the EEA/UK), and require all contracting parties to protect the personal data they process in accordance with applicable data protection law. Our agreements with our third-party partners, vendors and service providers may also include, where applicable, their certification under the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK extension to EU-U.S. DPF and/or Swiss-U.S. DPF certification (and any other country specific extension to the DPF Frameworks adopted from time to time), or reliance on the service provider's Binding Corporate Rules, as defined by the European Commission. In regard to the onward principle of the DPF Frameworks, if Expedia, Inc. learns that a third party is using or disclosing your Personal Information in a manner that is contrary to this Policy, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure. Expedia, Inc. may be liable for onward transfers of Personal Information to third parties in violation of this Policy and the DPF Frameworks (will change defined term if needed based on feedback above).
