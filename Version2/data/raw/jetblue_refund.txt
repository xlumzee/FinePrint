What if I have not received my travel credit refund?
If you cannot find your credit under your name, and you are traveling with others, check the reservation of the primary traveler in the original reservation.

Also, sign out of your JetBlue travel credit account and then sign in. If you still have not received the expected refund, contact us for additional assistance.
 
Be aware that some fees, such as tourism taxes, are nonrefundable in most cases.
All travel credits are subject to their original expiration date. If you booked using travel credit and cancel the ticket, any credit that has already expired will not be returned to your JetBlue travel credit account. Learn more about JetBlue travel credits.
Refundable fare policy
Refundable fare policy
For JetBlue refundable fares, cancellations are permitted any time prior to the scheduled departure for a full refund to the original form of payment. Refundable fares may not be available on all flights.

If an eligible refundable reservation is not changed or cancelled prior to the scheduled departure, all money associated with the reservation will be in the form of a JetBlue travel credit, valid for 12 months from original ticketing date, and may be applied toward future travel.

Partially used reservation
If you wish to cancel any remaining travel after a portion of your refundable trip has been taken, your refund amount will equal the one-way fare for the portion of the trip cancelled. This also applies if a portion of your travel is not operated as scheduled by JetBlue.

No show or missed flight
Refundable fares must be changed or cancelled prior to the scheduled departure time in order to receive a refund to the original form of payment. If a flight is missed, the money associated with the reservation will be in the form of a JetBlue travel credit, valid for 12 months from original ticketing date, and may be applied toward future travel.

See JetBlue travel credit info
Nonrefundable fare policy
Nonrefundable fare policy
For JetBlue nonrefundable fares, cancellations can be made prior to the scheduled departure. A per person cancellation fee may apply depending on the fare option selected. Any remaining balance will be in the form of a JetBlue travel credit, valid for 12 months from original ticketing date.

No show or missed flight
If an eligible nonrefundable reservation is not changed or cancelled prior to scheduled departure, all money associated with the reservation will be forfeited. This includes extra ancillary purchases such as EvenMore® seat selection, priority security, additional checked bag fees, etc.

Frequently asked questions
Fare change questions
I changed my flight, and my fare is less. Where will my refund go?
The refunded amount will automatically be issued to your JetBlue travel credit account as a JetBlue travel credit. If you have a Blue Basic fare, change fees will apply before the refund is issued. 
The refund will not be returned to your original form of payment. 
Learn more about JetBlue travel credits. 
Can I refund my current ticket to get a lower fare?
You can cancel and rebook your fare at the current rate on the website. If you have a Blue Basic ticket, all fees apply.  
If during your rebooking process the price of the fare increases, we cannot reinstate your previous fare. You will need to purchase the fare at the current price that is shown.

Airport issues
How do I get compensated for a trip that did not go as planned?
Please review our Customer Service Plan and Our Promises for more information on how we want to make things right, when things go wrong. 
JetBlue does not provide compensation for uncontrollable events. See Our Promises.
For travel booked directly through JetBlue:
If your flight qualifies for compensation, you will receive an email from JetBlue within seven days of your flight's scheduled departure. This will happen automatically and there is no need to contact JetBlue.
Heads up: Beginning in early 2026, Customer Bill of Rights compensation will be issued as TrueBlue points instead of a JetBlue travel credit. To receive points, customers must have a TrueBlue account attached to their reservation prior to departure.
For travel not booked directly through JetBlue:
We may not have your contact information, so if your flight qualifies for compensation, please contact us seven days or more after your flight's scheduled departure to inquire about potential compensation.
I did not bring correct travel documents. Can I get a refund?
The ticket will be subject to regular fare rules for refunds.  
JetBlue does not refund the original form of payment if you missed the flight due to incorrect or expired travel documents. Please note: It is the Customer’s responsibility to check for specific document requirements for the country you are visiting. See the handy online documentation lookup tool on jetblue.com.   
My flight was delayed, but then it left earlier. I missed it.
JetBlue does not issue refunds for missing delayed flights.
For delays, we suggest you arrive at the airport for the originally scheduled departure time, since departure times can continue to change. If the delay is shorter than predicted, the flight may leave on time.
