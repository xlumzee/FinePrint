You may send us requests for this information to privacy@snorkel.ai. In your request, you must include the statement "Shine the Light Request", and provide your first and last name and mailing address and certify that you are a California resident.

Notice to European Users
The information provided in this "Notice to European Users" section applies only to individuals in Europe.

Legal bases for processing. We use your personal information only as permitted by law, for the purposes for which we collected it as listed below. In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your personal information, the European data protection legislation requires us to ensure that we have a "legal basis" for that use. Our legal bases for processing your personal information described in this Privacy Policy are listed below.

Where we need to perform a contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you ("Contractual Necessity").
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests ("Legitimate Interests"). More detail about the specific legitimate interests pursued in respect of each Purpose we use your personal information for is set out in the table below.
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation ("Compliance with Law").
Where we have your specific consent to carry out the processing for the Purpose in question ("Consent"). Generally, we do not rely on your Consent as a legal basis for using your personal information other than in the context of direct marketing communications.
We have set out below, in a table format, the legal bases we rely on in respect of the relevant Purposes for which we use your personal information.

Use for new purposes. We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.

Sensitive personal information. We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Service, or otherwise to us. If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Service, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our Service.

Automated Decision-Making and Profiling. We may use automated decision-making and/or profiling in regard to your personal information when you apply for a job opportunity and for automated lead qualification when you submit your information to receive a demo. You can request a manual review of the accuracy of an automated decision that you are unhappy with or limit or object to such automated decision-making and/or profiling by contacting us at privacy@snorkel.ai

Retention
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Your rights
European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information. If you are located within the European Union, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:

Access. Provide you with information about our processing of your Personal Data and give you access to your Personal Data.
