Identification information. We collect information necessary to verify your identity, including a photo of you, a photo or scan of your driver's license, and your government-issued identification number (e.g., your Social Security Number or Social Insurance Number).

Commercial information. We may collect driver and vehicle information from you, such as your driver's license number, your license plate, the model and make of your car, other vehicle or registration information, and insurance information.

Financial information. In order to pay you for your services, we will collect your bank account and routing number.

Health and medical information. We collect information about illnesses that you share with us voluntarily or if required by law, such as screening information to help us prevent the spread of infectious diseases and ensure the safety of our Shoppers and customers.

Other information you provide to us. We collect other information you choose to provide, including when you communicate with our CARE agents, respond to our surveys/questionnaires, and during your interactions with our Services, with our employees and with our community affairs efforts. The information that you provide may include demographic information.

b. Information collected by automated means

When you use and interact with the Services, we automatically receive certain information about your device, browser, and your activity:

Device and usage information. Our servers will record information about the device you use to connect to the Services and your usage of the Services. This information includes your device's IP address, your device type, browser type, internet service provider, operating system, and unique device identifiers. It also includes activity information, such as the frequency with which you use the Services, the duration of such usage, the pages that you navigate to, links that you click. We also collect information regarding your interactions with our chat bots, emails, texts, notifications or other marketing from us (e.g., whether you opened or clicked an email).

Transaction Information. We collect information related to your shopping and/or delivery services through Instacart (such as the number of orders accepted, declined or canceled, cancelation rates, the date and time of orders you accepted, declined or completed, distance traveled, items found, and items replaced), and other ways that you interact with the Services.

Geolocation information. In order to provide services as a Shopper, you must enable your mobile device to share your location information with us. You can enable this sharing through the settings on your device or when prompted to do so in the Instacart Shopper application. We may collect your location information any time the Instacart Shopper application is running in the foreground (i.e., fully visible on the screen) or in the background (i.e., not the focus on the screen) on your mobile device.

We use precise geolocation information to determine your presence in a specific delivery zone, to assist you in finding opportunities to shop for customers, to facilitate deliveries, to track the progress of batches you accepted, and for other similar Service-related purposes. We may also use this information for internal analytics purposes.

Cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies. When you visit our websites, access our mobile apps or otherwise interact with the Services, we (and our partners, advertisers, and third-party advertising networks) may automatically collect information about you using device identifiers, cookies and other technologies (e.g., pixels, software development kits (SDKs)). We use this collected information for various purposes, including to make the Services function properly; understand how you use the Services; personalize your experience; and measure, manage, display, and customize the advertisements you see.

Our partners, advertisers, and third-party advertising networks may also use these technologies to collect information about your online activity over time and across different websites or online services.

Browsers provide choices with respect to these technologies. By using your browser settings, you may block cookies or adjust settings for notifications when a cookie is set. By using your browser settings, you may block cookies or adjust settings for notifications when a cookie is set. You can learn more about cookies and how they work at www.allaboutcookies.org.

Analytics We use third-party analytics providers who may deploy cookies, pixels, or similar technologies to analyze traffic to the Services and understand the usage of the Services as well as the performance of advertisements. For example, we use Google Analytics, an analytics tool that helps us understand how Shoppers engage with the Services. To learn more about Google Analytics' data practices, please visit Google's support page.

Interest-based or online behavioral advertising We may participate in interest-based advertising using cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies. This means that you may see advertisements while using the Services that are tailored to you, or you may see advertisements for Instacart on other online services (such as Facebook), based on your use of the Services. Some services where we may advertise belong to ad networks that use your web browsing history to choose which advertisements to display on their network services, which may include advertisements from Instacart.

You can learn more about interest-based advertising, and navigate to options that will allow you to exercise your rights to opt-out of online behavioral advertising, by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative's Learn More Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance. In addition, some internet browsers, websites/platforms, and mobile devices allow you to exercise certain choices with respect to interest-based advertising. Please refer to the website that you are visiting, your browser, and/or your mobile device settings for additional information.

Please note that even if you opt-out using the tools listed above, you may continue to see advertisements from Instacart and/or our partners; however, these advertisements will not be as relevant to you.

Do Not Track "Do Not Track" ("DNT") is a developing standard for web browsers that aims to inform the websites you visit that you do not want information about your online activity collected over time and across third-party websites. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of Shoppers, we do not interpret or respond to DNT or other similar signals from your browser at this time. For more information, visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

Background check providers: During the application process and annually and annually, we conduct and collect information in connection with certain background checks, such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), license status, and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on our behalf.

Our retailers;
Partners with whom we work for advertising, advertising measurement, attribution, analytics, or placement (including on the Services and on third-party services);

This includes using your Personal Information to match you with available opportunities to shop and/or deliver for customers. To do so, we use your location information, your availability, your proximity to a batch, your personal preferences and other information. We also use your Personal Information to optimize our Services, such as to map out optimal delivery routes when you have accepted a batch, track the progress of batches you have accepted and estimate delivery times of batches for which you are shopping and/or delivering, and understand cancellation rates.

Communicate with you. If you become a Shopper, we use your Personal Information to communicate with you, including to provide you with relevant information and respond to your requests. From time to time, we may use your Personal Information to send important updates to you about the Services and communications about changes to this Privacy Policy or other applicable terms, conditions, and policies.

Carry out our marketing and advertising activities. We (and our partners) use your Personal Information to send you marketing and promotional materials and communications, including interest-based advertisements. Details on how to exercise your choices with respect to marketing and promotional materials communications from us can be found in the Your Choices section below.

Maintain security and prevent fraud. We use your Personal Information to help maintain the security and integrity of the Services and to detect, prevent, investigate, and protect you, our business, customers, and other individuals from fraud, unauthorized transactions, and other unsafe activity. For example, we use Personal Information such as device information, location information, images shoppers submit during the identity verification process, a shopper's pattern of activity on the Instacart platform, and other data to help detect, prevent, or stop the use of shopper and customer accounts by unauthorized persons or other fraudulent behaviors. If fraudulent behavior is detected, it may result in the automatic deactivation of a Shopper's account.

Satisfy our legal obligations. We use your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, respond to legal process, and/or respond to requests and communications from law enforcement authorities or other government officials.

As otherwise necessary or appropriate. We will use your Personal Information for other purposes at your direction or with your consent. Additionally, we will use your Personal Information as we believe necessary or appropriate to protect our rights, privacy, safety, property, or those of others.

Please note that we may combine Personal Information that we collect (as described above) with information from other sources and use the combined information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

3. Information Disclosure
In connection with one or more of the purposes outlined above, we may disclose your Personal Information to the categories of recipients described below.

With your consent or at your direction. We may share your information with entities outside of Instacart when we have your consent to do so or it is done at your direction.

Our subsidiaries and affiliates. We will disclose your Personal Information to our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy and/or other business and operational purposes.

Our service providers and third-party partners. We will disclose your Personal Information to third parties that provide services to us, including: system hosting, management and support services; data security and storage services; analytics services; identity verification and background check services; and payment processing services.

Our marketing and advertising partners. We will disclose your Personal Information to our marketing and advertising partners, including social media platforms, third-party advertising networks, and other parties that assist us in serving and measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements.

Our research partners. We will disclose your Personal Information to our research partners, including those performing surveys or research projects in partnership with us or on our behalf.

Customers. If you are a Shopper, we will disclose some of your Personal Information to customers in connection with your shopping on their behalf and/or delivery of their orders. For example, we may display your first name, last initial, and your geolocation to customers to show them who is shopping and/or delivering their orders.

Our retail partners. We may disclose your Personal Information to our retail partners in order to provide and maintain the Instacart service. For example, we may need to disclose your contact information to a retail partner to enable you to deliver certain products (e.g., alcohol). In addition, we may provide your information to a retail partner if there is a complaint, dispute, or conflict between you and the retail partner or a customer or to prevent or stop activity that we or a retail partner considers to be inappropriate, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable.

In connection with legal matters. We may share your information when we believe that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or requests.

Third parties in connection with a sale or business transaction. We may sell or purchase assets during the normal course of business. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information that we have collected may be transferred to such entity and its advisors leading up to and/or following the transaction. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, information that we hold may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties.

Other third parties. We will also disclose your Personal Information to parties as we believe necessary or appropriate either: (a) under applicable law; (b) to protect our operations and those of any of our subsidiaries or affiliates; (c) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or those of others; or (d) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit damages that we may sustain.

Additionally, we may disclose your Personal Information for other reasons that we will describe at the time of information collection or prior to disclosing your information.

4. Cross-Border Transfers
Instacart operates a global business, and we use vendors located around the world to help us run our business. Accordingly, the disclosures described above may result in the transfer of your Personal Information outside of the country or region in which you reside. For example, the Personal Information of Shoppers located in Canada will be transferred outside of Canada (and for residents of Quebec, outside of Quebec), including to the United States.

When we transfer your Personal Information outside of your country or province of residence, we do so in accordance with applicable law and take appropriate steps to ensure your information is protected. However, please note that while outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, some of your Personal Information will be subject to applicable local laws, which may permit government and national security authorities in those jurisdictions to access your Personal Information in certain circumstances.

5. Biometric Information
When you become a Shopper and at regular intervals thereafter, we process your biometric information, including biometric identifiers, to verify your identity, protect the integrity of our platform, and detect and prevent fraud. Instacart or its third-party service providers collect and process biometric identifiers (namely, scans of facial geometry) from the government identification and selfie images you provide.

The purpose of this identity verification is to promote the safety of Shoppers and our customers and to protect the integrity of our platform by ensuring that only valid and verified Shoppers provide Services.

We retain your biometric information, including biometric identifiers, until the initial purpose for collecting the biometric information has been satisfied or for up to three years following your last activity as a Shopper, whichever occurs first, after which we permanently destroy it, unless otherwise required by law. We retain your government identification and the images you provide, including to serve as your Shopper avatar, in accordance with the "Information Retention" section of this Policy.

6. Children's Privacy
Shoppers must be 18 years of age. Our Services are not available to minors.

7. Third-Party Websites and Services
Some links on the Services may redirect you to third-party websites and services that we do not operate. This includes links to sign up for Shopper perks that are offered by third-party companies. The privacy practices of these websites and services will be governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy policies before disclosing any Personal Information to them.

8. Information Security
We employ and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to safeguard and protect Personal Information under our control from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.

9. Information Retention
We keep Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information; the purposes for which we use the Personal Information; whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable laws that require us to retain information for regulatory purposes or permit us to retain the information to preserve our legal rights.

See the Biometric Information section above for information about how long we retain biometric information, including biometric identifiers.

b. Sale and Sharing of Personal Information

As described in the table above, we share your Personal Information for Behavioral Advertising and we may also share it with certain analytics or other vendors in a manner that could be considered a "sale" under California law. Please see the Exercising your rights section below for information on how to opt-out of such sharing or sales.

c. Use and disclosure of sensitive Personal Information

We only use or disclose sensitive Personal Information as necessary to provide the Services; to resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at our business; to ensure the physical safety of natural persons; and to maintain and improve the quality of our Services.

d. Exercising your rights

As a California resident, you have the right to request access to or deletion of your Personal Information, the right to request correction of your information, and the right to opt-out of both Behavioral Advertising and the sale of your Personal Information. This section directs you on how to exercise these rights. Please note that rights and requests may be subject to applicable exceptions. We will not discriminate against you if you decide to exercise these rights.

Prior to processing your request to access, delete or correct your information, we must verify the identity of the requestor to help ensure we do not for example provide your information to another person. We do so by requiring you to provide up to three pieces of Personal Information that we can match to information we have on file in.

Right to correct

To correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you:

If you have an active Instacart Shopper account, please log in to this account and visit the "Account Settings" page where you can correct your account information (including your name, address, telephone number, and financial information).

If you do not have access to your Instacart Shopper account, please send an email to shopperprivacy@instacart.com.

Right to access or delete

To request access to or deletion of your Personal Information:

If you have an active Shopper account, you may submit your access request by clicking here and a deletion request by clicking here.

If you do not have access to your Shopper account, please send an email to shopperprivacy@instacart.com.

Right to opt out of sales or sharing

To opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Information for Behavioral Advertising or the sale of your Personal Information, please submit your request by clicking here.

Alternatively, where available, you can use certain preference signals to exercise your sale and sharing opt-out right automatically with all businesses that you interact with online, including Instacart. If you enable a browser-based opt-out preference signal that complies with the CCPA, such as Global Privacy Control (GPC), upon receipt or detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information linked to that browser and any consumer profile we have associated with that browser. Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each one that you use.

Authorized agents

If you authorize a natural person or business entity to submit a request on your behalf (an "Authorized Agent"), the Authorized Agent may send an email to shopperprivacy@instacart.com to submit a request. As part of our verification process, we will require proof concerning their status as an Authorized Agent (which may include proof that they have power of attorney in accordance with California probate law) and we will directly confirm with you that you provided the person or business entity with permission to submit the request.

12. Disclosures for Residents of Canada
For information about the transfer and storage of your Personal Information outside of Canada, or if you are a resident of Québec, outside of your province of residence, please see the Cross-Border Transfers section above.

For some of the uses described in Section 2, we may use technological tools that render decisions about you automatically. These include tools that allocate orders to shoppers, or detect fraud or cancellation rates, which may lead to account deactivation.

If you are a resident of Canada, you may submit an access or deletion request as explained here. Requests may be submitted by Authorized Agents as described here.

13. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information and/or changes in applicable law.

The "Last updated" date at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. If we make changes, we will revise the date at the top of this Privacy Policy and, in the case of material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may provide you with additional notice (such as a notice posted on the Services or a message delivered to the email address that we have on file for you).
