How We Use Information This section explains how we use the information we collect.,none,snapchat_privacy
"Among other things, we use the information we collect to provide you with personalized products and Services that we work hard to build and improve.",none,snapchat_privacy
"Below, we walk through each purpose for which we use information in detail.",none,snapchat_privacy
"If you’d like to see a mapping of the data we collect with the purposes for which we collect it, we have a table here.",none,snapchat_privacy
"Keep Things Up & Running (i.e., operate, deliver, and maintain our Services) We use the information we collect in order to operate, deliver, and maintain our Services.",none,snapchat_privacy
"For example, by delivering a Snap you want to send to a friend or, if you share your location on Snap Map, to show you suggestions like places you might like in your neighborhood, content others have posted to the Map, or your friends if they’re sharing their location with you.",none,snapchat_privacy
"We also use some of your information to help keep our products up to date, for example to make sure that our Services work with the latest operating systems and devices.",none,snapchat_privacy
Personalize Your Experience & Give Context We offer personalized Services to Snapchatters.,none,snapchat_privacy
One of the ways we do this is by showing you content that is relevant to you or we think you may enjoy based on the information you share with us.,none,snapchat_privacy
"To do so, we use information about you across different areas of the Services in order to add context to your Snapchat experience.",none,snapchat_privacy
"For example, we automatically tag content with labels based on the content, your location, or the time of day.",none,snapchat_privacy
"So if there's a dog in the photo, it may be searchable in Memories by the term “dog,” show up on the Map at the location where you created the Memory, and inform us that you’re into dogs so we can surface you fun dog videos and dog food ads in other parts of our Services, such as Spotlight.",none,snapchat_privacy
Personalization can also help with suggesting friends or recommending a new friend to send a Snap to based on who you Snap with the most.,none,snapchat_privacy
"We may show recommended places on the Snap Map, generate stickers, or even generate Snaps and other content using AI, infer your interests based on your content or activity, or customize the content we show you, including ads.",none,snapchat_privacy
"For example, if you watch barista content on Spotlight, talk to My AI about your favorite espresso machine, or save a lot of coffee-related Snaps in your Memories, we may highlight coffee shops on the Snap Map when you visit a new city or show you content about coffee that you may find interesting or relevant.",none,snapchat_privacy
"Or, if you interact with a lot of music venues we may use that to show you ads for upcoming shows in town.",none,snapchat_privacy
"Personalization also includes tailoring your experience based on who you interact with most and what your friends are doing, including showing you content your friends create, like, or enjoy on Spotlight or Place recommendations that are popular with your friends.",none,snapchat_privacy
Our goal is to continuously provide you with more relevant and interesting content.,none,snapchat_privacy
"For example, if you watch a lot of sports content, but skip content with hair and makeup tips, our recommendation algorithms will prioritize sports, but not those makeup tips.",none,snapchat_privacy
You can learn more about how we understand Snapchatter preferences and rank and moderate content here.,none,snapchat_privacy
We believe it is critical to also balance the benefits of personalization with our Snapchatters’ expectations of privacy.,none,snapchat_privacy
"For example, we may automatically tag the Snaps you save to Memories based on the content within it (e.g., the Snap contained a dog), and then use that tag to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads (such as showing you Spotlight Snaps containing dogs).",none,snapchat_privacy
"We do not use the private content and communications you send to your friends to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads.",none,snapchat_privacy
Provide Relevant Ads Another way we provide a personalized Service is through the ads we show.,none,snapchat_privacy
"We use your interests and preferences from the information we’ve collected to personalize, target, and measure ads.",none,snapchat_privacy
We think ads are best when they’re relevant.,none,snapchat_privacy
That’s why we try to select the right ads and show them to you at the right time.,none,snapchat_privacy
"For example, if you’ve interacted with ads for video games, we will infer that you like video games, and show you similar ads, but those won’t be the only ads you see.",none,snapchat_privacy
"Similar to our content strategy, we try to ensure you receive a variety of ads.",none,snapchat_privacy
We also use your information to avoid showing you ads you probably won’t be interested in.,none,snapchat_privacy
"For example, if a ticketing site tells us you’ve previously bought tickets for a movie — we can stop showing you ads for it.",none,snapchat_privacy
You can learn about the different types of advertising and your choices about which ads you receive here.,none,snapchat_privacy
"You can learn more about how we collect, use, and share your information for advertising purposes here.",none,snapchat_privacy
