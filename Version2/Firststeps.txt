Order of Implementation
1) 
Raw Policy → Extract → Clean → Summarize → Output
made an Extractor.py, summarizer.py using an llm from openai - giving it a prompt and api call. loads a policy and summarizes in 5 bullet points
Done 

2) 
Handle long policies - Chunking + combining summaries. Big companies have big policies - far too long for a single llm call.
Chunk long text → summarize each chunk → combine summaries → produce final summary
Scaling
Done

3)
Risk detection engine
Detect important clause categories
Highlight the risky or user - impactful clauses
- First rule based detection
