labels.yml 
YAML - is a simple, human-readable format for storing configuration or structured data — like JSON, but cleaner and easier to edit manually.
- Defines the categories you’re detecting (Arbitration, Data Sharing, etc.)
- Stores extra metadata like severity and explanations
- Lets your model, UI, and extension all read from the same source of truth
