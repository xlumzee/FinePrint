labels.yml 
YAML - is a simple, human-readable format for storing configuration or structured data — like JSON, but cleaner and easier to edit manually.
- Defines the categories you’re detecting (Arbitration, Data Sharing, etc.)
- Stores extra metadata like severity and explanations
- Lets your model, UI, and extension all read from the same source of truth

src 
    io_utils.py 
    Handles input/output: reads different file types(txt, pdf, html) and saves sentence-level JSONL files.
    Keeps data loading consistent no matter where the text comes from.


    preprocess.py 
    Cleans and splits text into sentences using spaCy. Also generates stable doc_ids from file paths.
    Gives normalized, sentence-level units for later ML work.


    rules.py
    Contains weak-label regex rules to classify sentences as risk, safe, info, or neutral.
    Simulates early supervision — will train models on these later.


    Summarize.py
    Implements extractive summarization: embeds sentences (MiniLM) and selects the most diverse, central ones with MMR.
    Produces readable summaries without deep learning or LLMs.


    report.py
    Assembles Markdown summaries combining general TL;DR, pitfalls, and benefits bullets.
    Gives you a human-readable output artifact.


How data flows

raw file → io.read_text()
   ↓
normalize + sentence split → preprocess.to_sentences()
   ↓
weak labeling → rules.label_sentence()
   ↓
store labeled sentences → data/processed/...
   ↓
summarize (MMR) → summarize.mmr()
   ↓
generate Markdown summary → report.write_markdown()
